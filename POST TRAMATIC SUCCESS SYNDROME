POST TRAMATIC SUCCESS SYNDROME 

People suffer from paranoia not proanoia, where people think good things are gonna happen, like you hear a noise tapping in your window at night and think "oh that must be someone trying to bring me cake" or thinking the illumati and the lizard people are conspiracing to help you have a good life, like they are putting some sort of IQ boosting juice 

Sure, here are some alternative punchlines that expand on the idea of "post-tremendous success syndrome"

"I wish I had post-tremendous success syndrome, then I could relive my glory days on a loop, like a never-ending highlight reel."

"I mean, imagine if we got post-tremendous success syndrome instead of post-traumatic stress disorder. We'd be like 'Oh no, not that song again, it reminds me of the time we won the championship.'"

"I mean, think about it, post-tremendous success syndrome would be like getting stuck in a time loop of your best moments. Like, 'Oh no, not that smell again, it reminds me of the time we sold out Madison Square Garden.'"

"I wish post-tremendous success syndrome was a real thing, then every time I saw a picture of me with a big check, I'd get a rush of endorphins."

"Imagine if post-tremendous success syndrome was real, every time someone asked how your day was, you'd be like, 'Oh, just reliving the time we won the lottery.'"
